# About
Specialized program to compute the cosine similarity of a vectorized word with the sum of the vector of the words preceding it. The motivation of this program was to
provide further evidence of the correlation between the N400(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N400_(neuroscience)) and how surprising a word's appearance is in different sentences. Uses Pandas for fast traversal of input CSV file.
